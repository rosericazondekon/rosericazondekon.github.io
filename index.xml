Introduction In this tutorial, I show you how to download raw sequence data from the European instance of the SRA, which can be accessed via https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena. At ENA, the sequencing reads are directly available in FASTQ or SRA formats, which will be explained below.
For this tutorial, we need FastQC, multiQC, the SRA toolkit, the subread package, a powerful suite of tools designed to interact with SAM and BAM files called samtools, salmon, and STAR installed and referenced in the environment variable PATH.</description></item><item><title>AuthorVis</title><link>https://rosericazondekon.github.io/blog/projects/auhorvis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rosericazondekon.github.io/blog/projects/auhorvis/</guid><description>AuthorVis is a co-authorship network exploration, and link prediction tool specific to the scientific collaborative research network of Malaria, Tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS in the Republic of Benin. This project is the result of an extensive study of co-authorship network entitled &amp;ldquo;Network Analysis of Scientific Collaboration and Co-authorship of the Trifecta of Malaria, Tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS in Benin.&amp;rdquo;
While many network visualization solutions have already been published, most of them are not specifically adapted to co-authorship network.</description></item><item><title>Global Vaccination Survey Analyzer</title><link>https://rosericazondekon.github.io/blog/projects/gvsa/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rosericazondekon.github.io/blog/projects/gvsa/</guid><description>The Global Vaccination Survey Analyzer (GVSA) is a standardized tool to support the analysis of vaccination survey data among displaced populations. I developed the GVSA as a standalone shiny application for the CDC with the support of UNHCR.
It enables users to easily review vaccination surveys conducted in displaced populations, automatically analyze, visualize vaccination survey results in easy to read dashboards, and generate downloadable reports.
The application can be used to analyze surveys evaluating coverage of both Supplemental Immunization Activities (SIAs), and Routine Immunization (RI) in acute and proctrated humanitarian settings.</description></item><item><title>Integrated RNA-seq Analysis Application</title><link>https://rosericazondekon.github.io/blog/projects/irnaa/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rosericazondekon.github.io/blog/projects/irnaa/</guid><description>The Integrated RNA-seq Analysis Application (IRNAA) is a shiny application built for the purpose of facilitating Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis. IRNAA integrates command line tools such as salmon, fastQC, multiQC with DGE R packages such as DESeq2, edgeR, and limma-voom, and hides all the abstractions and coding hurdles from the end user.
IRNAA makes it possible for the user to either preprocess fastq files and import read counts into the application from the fastq preprocessed files, or directly import their read counts into the application, or import RNA-seq datasets directly from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).</description></item><item><title>kdtEstimator</title><link>https://rosericazondekon.github.io/blog/projects/kdtestimator/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rosericazondekon.github.io/blog/projects/kdtestimator/</guid><description>The kdtEstimator is a small Shiny application designed specifically for the estimation of Knock-Down Time based on aggregated WHO or CDC bottle Bioassay data. The application is primarily dedicated to Entomologists interested in the study of vector resistance to insecticides.
Other scientists interested in the estimation of measures like Lethal Dose 50 (LD50) or Lethal Concentration (LC50) may also use it.

These templates are developed in collaboration with the members of the Community of Practice (CoP) and the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP).
The goal is to make a wide collection of report templates accessible and easily distributable via the Rnssp R package.

Its goal is to improve code reproducibility, standardize and document reusable functions, facilitate the sharing of routine reports across the NSSP Community of Practice (CoP), and better engage the NSSP CoP.
The NSSP is a collaboration among CDC programs, federal partners, and local and state jurisdiction who participatein an active CoP.</description></item><item><title>VirusSeq Pipeline</title><link>https://rosericazondekon.github.io/blog/projects/virusseqpipeline/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rosericazondekon.github.io/blog/projects/virusseqpipeline/</guid><description>The VirusSeq software is a next generation sequencing software of human cancer tissue. Its goal is to identify viruses and their integration sites in human cancer cells. VirusSeq was originally developed by Chen and collaborators and reported in a 2012 paper published in Bioinformatics.
Although the software is open source and freely available, its installation is not at the ease of the novice user. VirusSeq has not been designed to effectively and efficiently process multiple samples.</description></item></channel></rss>
