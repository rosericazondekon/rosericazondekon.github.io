Introduction In this tutorial, I show you how to download raw sequence data from the European instance of the SRA, which can be accessed via https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena. At ENA, the sequencing reads are directly available in FASTQ or SRA formats, which will be explained below.
For this tutorial, we need FastQC, multiQC, the SRA toolkit, the subread package, a powerful suite of tools designed to interact with SAM and BAM files called samtools, salmon, and STAR installed and referenced in the environment variable PATH.</description></item><item><title>Differential Gene Expression Analysis</title><link>https://rosericazondekon.github.io/posts/differential-gene-expression/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 00:30:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://rosericazondekon.github.io/posts/differential-gene-expression/</guid><description>Disclaimer: This tutorial was originally written on April 01, 2019.
Introduction In a previous tutorial, we showed you how to download and process RNA-seq FASTQ files for read alignment on a reference sequence, and for read quantification. In this tutorial, we show you how to conduct Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis using the DESeq2, edgeR, and limma packages.
We set our working directory to the tuto folder created in our first tutorial.</description></item><item><title>Bisulfite Treated Sequence Read Alignment</title><link>https://rosericazondekon.github.io/posts/bisulfite-treated-read-align/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2022 13:08:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://rosericazondekon.github.io/posts/bisulfite-treated-read-align/</guid><description>Disclaimer: This tutorial was originally written on May 30, 2019.
Introduction In this tutorial, we show you how to download raw Bisulfite-seq DNA methylation sequence data from the European instance of the SRA, which can be accessed via https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena. On the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) website, the sequencing reads are directly available in FASTQ or SRA formats, which will be explained below.
For this tutorial, we need FastQC, multiQC, the SRA toolkit, a powerful suite of tools designed to interact with SAM and BAM files called samtools, and the Bismark aligner to align the Bisulfite-seq reads to the reference genome.</description></item><item><title>Bisulfite Treated DNA Methylation Analysis</title><link>https://rosericazondekon.github.io/posts/bsseq-dna-methylation-analysis/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jan 2022 12:56:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://rosericazondekon.github.io/posts/bsseq-dna-methylation-analysis/</guid><description>Disclaimer: This tutorial was originally written on June 06, 2019.
Introduction In a previous tutorial, we showed you how to download and process Bisulfite-treated sequence DNA methylation FASTQ files for read alignment on a reference sequence. In this tutorial, we show you how to run DNA methylation analysis using the Bioconductor bsseq and dmrseq R packages.

Introduction In our DNA Methylation Sequence Read Alignment tutorial, we showed you how to download and process Bisulfite-treated sequence DNA methylation FASTQ files for read alignment on a reference sequence. In this tutorial, we show you how to run DNA methylation analysis using the Bioconductor methylKit R package.

The dataset for this tutorial is the Dataset of Vector Mosquito Images published by Pise and contributors in Mendeley Data (DOI:10.17632/88s6fvgg2p.4). We downloaded the Mosquito Images Augmented.zip for the purposes of this tutorial.
By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:
load and preprocess your own images into torch tensors import a prebuilt Artificial Neural Network architecture fit an Artificial Neural Network model to your data evaluate a deep learning model draw inference on a new image (predict a mosquito specie from an image) and deploy the image classification model as a shiny app This tutorial is inspired by the Classifying images with torch tutorial by Sigrid Keydana.</description></item></channel></rss>
