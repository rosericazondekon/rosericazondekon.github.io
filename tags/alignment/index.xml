Introduction In this tutorial, I show you how to download raw sequence data from the European instance of the SRA, which can be accessed via https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena. At ENA, the sequencing reads are directly available in FASTQ or SRA formats, which will be explained below.
For this tutorial, we need FastQC, multiQC, the SRA toolkit, the subread package, a powerful suite of tools designed to interact with SAM and BAM files called samtools, salmon, and STAR installed and referenced in the environment variable PATH.</description></item><item><title>DNA Methylation Read Sequence Alignment</title><link>https://rosericazondekon.github.io/posts/dna-methylation-read-align/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2022 13:08:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://rosericazondekon.github.io/posts/dna-methylation-read-align/</guid><description>Disclaimer: This tutorial was originally written on May 30, 2019.
Introduction In this tutorial, we show you how to download raw Bisulfite-seq DNA methylation sequence data from the European instance of the SRA, which can be accessed via https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena. On the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) website, the sequencing reads are directly available in FASTQ or SRA formats, which will be explained below.
For this tutorial, we need FastQC, multiQC, the SRA toolkit, a powerful suite of tools designed to interact with SAM and BAM files called samtools, and the Bismark aligner to align the Bisulfite-seq reads to the reference genome.</description></item></channel></rss>
