Introduction In this tutorial, we show you how to download raw Bisulfite-seq DNA methylation sequence data from the European instance of the SRA, which can be accessed via https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena. On the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) website, the sequencing reads are directly available in FASTQ or SRA formats, which will be explained below.
For this tutorial, we need FastQC, multiQC, the SRA toolkit, a powerful suite of tools designed to interact with SAM and BAM files called samtools, and the Bismark aligner to align the Bisulfite-seq reads to the reference genome.</description></item><item><title>Bisulfite Treated DNA Methylation Analysis</title><link>https://rosericazondekon.github.io/posts/bsseq-dna-methylation-analysis/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jan 2022 12:56:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://rosericazondekon.github.io/posts/bsseq-dna-methylation-analysis/</guid><description>Disclaimer: This tutorial was originally written on June 06, 2019.
Introduction In a previous tutorial, we showed you how to download and process Bisulfite-treated sequence DNA methylation FASTQ files for read alignment on a reference sequence. In this tutorial, we show you how to run DNA methylation analysis using the Bioconductor bsseq and dmrseq R packages.
We set our working directory to the tuto folder created in our previous tutorial.</description></item><item><title>DNA Methylation Analysis using methylKit</title><link>https://rosericazondekon.github.io/posts/methylkit-dna-methylation-analysis/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 11:47:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://rosericazondekon.github.io/posts/methylkit-dna-methylation-analysis/</guid><description>Disclaimer: This tutorial was originally written on June 04, 2019.
